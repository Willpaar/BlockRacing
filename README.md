Developed BlockRacing, a physics-based simulation in Java where users can design custom arenas by adding and arranging walls, squares, and obstacles. Users can manipulate object 
positions and velocities to see realistic collisions and bounces in real time. Focused on creating an interactive, intuitive environment for experimenting with physics and object dynamics.

you can run this program easily on any windows device as long as you have java 21+ installed.
